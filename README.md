### What I learned

I discovered less yesterday through the bootcamp I'm in and used it for this frontendmentor challenge, I struggled a lot figuring out how to override styles mostly on the mobile quesry since im still new to less and wanted to try the nesting features so bad, there's variables too but maybe next time. I had fun using it nonetheless and that, the fix i found is that, nesting a lot kind of adds to the specificity of said selector so I think that was the reason I cannot override my desktop styles when i start setting up the mobile version.

### Continued development

Umm I think I will come back to this in a couple of months to fix a couple of code snippets, make it kind of more efficient maybe
